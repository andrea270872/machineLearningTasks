Machine Learning tasks

This summer (2013) I'm reading a bit about Machine Learning. 
I found a course that is not too difficult, and I do need a "primer" :)

The lecture notes are here:

I would like to implement some of the stuff in python using numpy and scipy, not in matlab because 
Iâ€™m too green with that one and I would like to keep closer to programming.
