Lecture 1

- run perceptron_v0_3.py to load images and train the perceptron
  The program will save a data.bin file, that contains the weights for the perceptron
- then run perceptronB.py to test how good the perceptron is on new images
- finally use perceptronC.py to test how good the perceptron is on the original images (with noise)

Requires Python 2.7 and numpy, scipy and possibly matplotlib.
